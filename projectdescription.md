# 🌐 Eileen Esendi - Blog Website

## 🔍 Overview
This is a personal portfolio blog website designed as part of the Web Technologies assignment. The project demonstrates my ability to use **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript** to build a responsive, interactive, and visually appealing multipage website.

The portfolio highlights my background, skills, and projects, and allows visitors to contact me through a functional form. It is hosted live via **Netlify** and accessible through the link below.
